Tic-Tac-Foes
Tic-Tac-Foes is a custom implementation of a multi-mode Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Python and Tkinter. It includes classic, advanced, and ultimate modes, with additional features such as a splash screen, AI opponent, and responsive design.

Features
Classic Mode: Standard Tic-Tac-Toe game.
Advanced Mode: A variant of ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe where winning on any board results in winning the entire game, creating a more arcade experience than Ultimate Mode.
Ultimate Mode: A larger 9x9 grid with 9 smaller boards, following the Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe rules.
AI Opponent: Play against a basic AI that makes random moves.
